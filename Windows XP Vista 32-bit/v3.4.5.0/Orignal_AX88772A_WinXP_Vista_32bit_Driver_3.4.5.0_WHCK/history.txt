Version 3.4.3.35 (2009-09-03)
1. Move the TX flag cleared code from deregister function to link detect function.

Version 3.4.3.34 (2009-09-03)
1. Don't deregister endpoints if there are pending IRPs.

Version 3.4.3.33 (2009-08-25)
1. Fixed TX failure if unplug Ethernet cable and then plug Ethernet cable when network traffic is heavy.

Version 3.4.3.32 (2009-08-14)
1. Added SPX's MVCI VID/PID (AX88772).
2. Used EEPROM offset 0x17 to select the power saving mode.
3. Modified the options of the "Connection Type" parameter to the same definition as AX88772A/AX88772 Windows 7 and Vista drivers.
4. Modified to solve the Ethernet sometimes link failure issue during Standby/Resume test when two AX88772A boards are connected directly.

Version 3.4.3.31 (2009-06-18)
1. Add software multicast filter to pass WHQL test.

Version 3.4.3.30 (2009-06-10)
1. Reduce CPU utilization.
2. Modify Ethernet PHY ON/OFF policy to solve some link issue with specific switch.
3. Add USB error handling policy to process specific USB error.
4. Manually cancel all pending IRPs when driver stop.
5. Add Nikoa's VID/PID (AX88772A).
6. Restore the PHY Select Register after resume from hibernate.

Version 3.4.3.29 (2009-04-03)
1. Allocate new IRP for deregister endpoints function.

Version 3.4.3.28 (2009-03-27)
1. Set the USB port check retry times to 3.

Version 3.4.3.27 (2009-01-06)
1. Remove the filter driver since the WinXP Safely Remove list issue can be solved by BIOS.

Version 3.4.3.26 (2008-12-26)
1. Add a filter driver, let AX88772/AX88772A device does not appear in safely remove list.

2. Add PHY ON/OFF sequence procedure.
3. Add DisplayLink USB bandwidth solution.
4. Add MSI's PID/VID (AX88772A).
5. Add USB port status check when wakeup to avoid some issues if device was removed when computer in sleep mode.

Version 3.4.3.24 (2008-09-08)
1. Reduce the periodic holding time of CPU when Ethernet link down.

Version 3.4.3.23 (2008-06-24)

Note:
=====
1. The "Connection Type" parameter was modified to support the following options 
from v3.4.3.32 (same as AX88772A/AX88772 Windows 7/Vista drivers),

"AutoSense"
"10BaseT Half_Duplex"    (i.e. Auto-negotiation enabled with 10BaseT Half_Duplex capability only) 
"10BaseT Full_Duplex"    (i.e. Auto-negotiation enabled with 10BaseT Full_Duplex capability only) 
"100BaseTx Half_Duplex"  (i.e. Auto-negotiation enabled with 100BaseTx Half_Duplex capability only)  
"100BaseTx Full_Duplex"  (i.e. Auto-negotiation enabled with 100BaseTx Full_Duplex capability only)  

The "10BaseT Half_Duplex", "10BaseT Full_Duplex", "100BaseTx Half_Duplex" and "100BaseTx Full_Duplex" 
parameters are only for those advanced users that really know well the Auto-negotiation operation. 
For normal users, we suggest to use the "AutoSense" parameter directly.

If users want to set the "10BaseT Half_Duplex", "10BaseT Full_Duplex", "100BaseTx Half_Duplex" 
or "100BaseTx Full_Duplex" parameter, please make sure the link partner was also support 
the same capability, otherwise you might not be able to establish a successful Ethernet connection.
